# Campfire_Song-SBSP

Our lives are long
We can live to sing a song
Let's gather together for our campfire song 
Let's align ourselves in an ensemble for our campfire song 
Our C-A-M-P-F-I-R-E song
Blah blah blah blah blaaaaaaah
If you think we don't love our song
Then you are wrong
You should be joining with us for our perfect melody and rhythm of our precious song
Sing aloud with us for our campfire song
Our C-A-M-P-F-I-R-E song
Blah blah blah blah blaaaaaaah
